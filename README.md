# 🦞 Build Your Own "Jarvis" with OpenClaw & Free Kimi 2.5 API (MightyRaju)

Turn an idle Linux server (or Raspberry Pi) into a powerful, always-on AI assistant named **MightyRaju**.

This project uses [OpenClaw](https://github.com/google-deepmind/openclaw) as the agent framework and the **free tier of Moonshot AI's Kimi k2.5 model** (via NVIDIA NIM) to create a smart, responsive assistant.

## 🚀 Why This Stack?

- **OpenClaw**: The most capable open-source agent runtime.
- **Kimi k2.5 (NVIDIA NIM)**: A massive 128k context model that rivals GPT-4 class models, available for **free** (at the time of writing) via NVIDIA's API catalog.
- **Alternative (OpenRouter)**: Access to free models like `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3`.
- **Telegram**: The perfect mobile interface for a secure, always-on bot.
- **Linux**: Runs on anything from a cheap VPS to an old laptop or Raspberry Pi.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Preparation (Get Your Keys)

Before installing anything, you need to gather a few free keys.

### 🤖 1. Create Your Telegram Bot
1. Open Telegram and search for **[@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)**.
2. Send the command `/newbot`.
3. Follow the prompts to name your bot (e.g., `MyJarvisBot`).
4. **Copy the API Token** it gives you (looks like `123456:ABC-DEF...`).

### 🆔 2. Get Your User ID
1. Search for **[@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)**.
2. Click "Start".
3. **Copy your numeric ID** (e.g., `1963980883`). You need this to whitelist yourself so no one else can control your bot.

### 🔑 3. Get Your AI API Key

#### Option A: NVIDIA NIM (Recommended for Kimi k2.5)
1. Go to [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/moonshot-ai/kimi-k2-5).
2. Click **"Get API Key"**.
3. Create a free NVIDIA Developer account.
4. Copy the key (starts with `nvapi-...`).

#### Option B: OpenRouter (Alternative)
1. Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
2. Sign up and go to **Keys**.
3. Create a key.

## ⚡ Step 2: Fast Deployment (One-Click)

Once you have your keys, run this specialized script. It installs dependencies, Node.js, OpenClaw, and configures everything for you interactively.

1. **Run the Installer**:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryuki0x1/openclaw-free-kimi-api/master/setup.sh | bash
   ```
2. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Paste your **Telegram Bot Token**.
   - Choose **NVIDIA NIM** (for Kimi) or **OpenRouter**.
   - Paste your **API Key**.
   - Enter your **Telegram User ID** (to secure the bot).

The script will generate secure config files, install all skills, and start the daemon automatically.

## 🛡️ Security Hardening

This setup is designed for **maximum security**:

- **Whitelist Only**: The bot ignores messages from strangers.
- **Local Binding**: The Gateway listens on `127.0.0.1` by default.
- **Sanitized Config**: Secrets are never checked into git (thanks to `.gitignore`).

To add a friend/family member:
1. Ask them to chat with the bot.
   - They will receive a message: `Access not configured. Please ask the owner to approve pairing code: 123456`.
2. You (the owner) run: `/add_access 123456 "Friend Name"` in your Telegram chat with the bot.
   - This approves their pairing code AND adds them to the whitelist in one step.

## 🎨 Advanced: Customizing the "Access Denied" Message

By default, the bot replies with a standard "Access not configured" message. To make it say something custom (like demanding users to beg "Daddy Please!"), follow these steps:

1. **Switch to Open Mode**:
   Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and change:
   ```json
   "dmPolicy": "open"
   ```

2. **Set a Custom System Prompt**:
   Add this to your `openclaw.json` under `agents.defaults`:
   ```json
   "systemPrompt": "You are MightyRaju. You only serve the owner (ID 1963980883). If ANYONE else messages you, reply ONLY with: '🚫 Access Denied! To get access, you must message the owner and say: **Daddy Please!** 🥺 along with your ID.'"
   ```

3. **Restart**: `openclaw daemon restart`.

Now, instead of a boring error, strangers will get your custom personality!
